# Pyroch-predicting-amino-acid

The aim of this project is to use the data of amino acids (monopeptide) to predict the corresponding data of dipeptides which is combined by two amino acids. And also, after changing the parameter of dipeptides, this project may be used for predicting the corresponding properties of proteins.
